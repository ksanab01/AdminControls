WRITTEN IN EMBER

The website uses a series of constants that represent value in a database. These constants offer consistency across the site, ensuring that values can change dozens of references at once.

I, along with another developer, created in *EMBER* an user-friendly application that lets non-technical users add and changes values of constants that are used across the website. This application also let users handle permissions across SSC's multiple departmental systems.
